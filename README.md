# recipe1-app
I create a recipe-app use HTML CSS and JavaScript . I have created a navigation bar on the top. Searching for a recipe shows all recipes and as many card. Click to view recipe shown all ingredients and instructions.
popup will always show on center. If we search such word in this app which does not have any recipe then it will show "Error in fetching recipes.."
If we search without giving any input then it will show "Type the meal in the search box"
